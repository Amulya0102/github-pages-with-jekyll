I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Meditation
Of the many effective ways to deal with stress, meditation often tops the list. It is a technique that develops ‘soul consciousness’ and reduces stress. There are several meditative techniques. The popular ones include tai-chi and yoga. Reciting Buddhist chants is also an effective means of increasing the positive energy levels of your body.
